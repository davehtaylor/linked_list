# Linked Lists

This C module implements singly linked lists, and a variety of operations to perform on them. 

**Current Data Constraints**

By default, the list holds one element of signed integer data. 

**Current Operations**

- Creating the list
- Appending elements
- Prepending elements
- Counting the number of elements in the list
- Counting occurrences of a specific value
- Printing all elements in the list
- Deleting the first node
- Deleting the last node
- Deleting arbitrary elements
- Deleting all occurrences of a specific value
- Destroying the list

**Planned Features for Future Release**

- Inserting element at arbitrary point
- Swap two elements
- Reverse list
- Adding a 'length' element to the List struct
